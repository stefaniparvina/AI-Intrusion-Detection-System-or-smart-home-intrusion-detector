# AI-Powered Smart Home Intrusion Detection System

A Raspberry Pi-based security system that uses computer vision and motion detection to identify real threats while eliminating false alarms—achieving **0% false positive rate** and **97.8% reduction in computational workload** compared to traditional motion sensors.

## 🎯 Why This Matters

Traditional home security systems have a critical flaw: they can't tell the difference between a burglar and your cat. This leads to:
- Constant false alarms from pets, shadows, and moving objects
- User fatigue and system deactivation
- Wasted energy from continuous processing

Our system solves this by combining **PIR motion sensing** with **YOLOv11-powered computer vision** to detect only human intrusions, sending real-time Telegram notifications with visual evidence.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Zero False Positives**: Accurately distinguishes humans from pets, shadows, and environmental movement
- **Energy Efficient**: Motion-triggered processing reduces CPU usage by 67% and processes 97.8% fewer frames
- **Real-Time Alerts**: Instant Telegram notifications with GIF captures of detected intrusions
- **Flexible Input**: Works with live camera feed or pre-recorded video
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Web-based Streamlit dashboard for easy configuration and monitoring
- **Modular Architecture**: Clean, extensible codebase for easy customization

## 🚀 Performance Highlights

| Metric | Traditional PIR | Our System |
|--------|----------------|------------|
| False Positive Rate | 60% (9/15 scenarios) | **0%** (0/15 scenarios) |
| Human Detection Accuracy | 100% | **100%** |
| Frames Processed (1 hour) | 7,708 | **171** |
| Average CPU Usage | 81.4% | **25.9%** |
| Energy Reduction | Baseline | **67.2%** |

## 📦 Installation

### Prerequisites
```bash
# Hardware setup
- Raspberry Pi 5
- PIR sensor connected to GPIO PIN 26
- Raspberry Pi Camera Module installed
```

### Software Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Team-17-AI/AI-Intrusion-Detection-System-or-smart-home-intrusion-detector.git
cd AI-Intrusion-Detection-System-or-smart-home-intrusion-detector

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Telegram Bot Configuration

1. Create a Telegram bot via [@BotFather](https://t.me/botfather)
2. Get your bot token and chat ID
3. Configure in the Streamlit sidebar or create `config.json`:

```json
{
    "telegram_bot_token": "YOUR_BOT_TOKEN",
    "telegram_chat_id": "YOUR_CHAT_ID",
    "telegram_notifications_enabled": true
}
```

## 🎮 Usage

```bash
# Start the system
streamlit run app.py
```

Open your browser to `http://localhost:8501`

**Configuration Options:**
- Choose between live camera or video file input
- Adjust detection sensitivity
- Configure notification cooldown period
- Enable/disable Telegram alerts

## 📊 Experimental Validation

Our system was rigorously tested across 15 scenarios including:
- Normal/fast/low movement patterns
- Partial visibility and obstruction
- Multiple people
- Clothing variations (hooded, masked)
- Environmental false triggers (shadows, objects, pets)

**Full research paper**: [View PDF Report](./17-FinalReport-1.pdf)

### Energy Optimization Results

We tested multiple optimization strategies:
- **PIR-Triggered Detection**: 67.2% reduction in CPU usage
- **Frame Skipping**: Configurable sampling rates (0.05s to 1s intervals)
- **Idle Scheduling**: Minimal resource usage during inactivity

See our [detailed experimental results](./17-FinalReport-1.pdf) for complete performance analysis.

## 🛠️ Customization

**Adjust Detection Parameters:**
```python
# motion_detector.py
DETECTION_ACTIVE_DURATION_S = 30  # Detection window after PIR trigger

# utils.py
NUM_JPG_FRAMES_TO_SAVE = 5       # Frames saved as images
NUM_GIF_FRAMES = 10              # Frames in notification GIF
```

**Change Notification Settings:**
```python
# telegram_notifier.py
NOTIFICATION_COOLDOWN_S = 60     # Minimum time between alerts
```

## 🔬 Technical Deep Dive

### Why YOLOv11?
- Single-pass detection architecture (faster than R-CNN)
- Optimized for edge devices like Raspberry Pi
- Pre-trained on 80+ object classes (COCO dataset)
- Configurable confidence thresholds

### Energy Efficiency Strategy
1. PIR sensor acts as first-stage filter (low power)
2. Camera and AI activate only on motion detection
3. Frame skipping reduces unnecessary processing
4. Configurable sleep intervals during idle periods

### False Positive Elimination
Traditional PIR sensors trigger on any thermal change. Our system adds a second verification layer using computer vision to confirm human presence, filtering out:
- Pet movement
- Shadow changes
- Object displacement
- Environmental factors (wind, light changes)
